### How It Works
The game works in two halves. In one half, the player is a robot walking around inside a submerged structure. The other half is direct observation of the fish outside the structure. A

### What I Am Most Proud Of:


### What I Learned:
One thing I learned was about the dangers of feature creep when developing a game. I spent a lot of time developing features that I had not intended to be a part of the experience from the beginning. The ability to throw and pick up objects was a last minute addition, that almost did not work. It is always important to focus on the core features of the game first and foremost.
